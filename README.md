## Building the Distribution:

#### Base OS Preparation:
- Install a minimal Debian 12 from https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/
- set username to '**siyasat**'
- Do not select a desktop environment during install. You might want to choose ssh server to continue installation remotely.

#### Building
- clone this repo:
```
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/LandonGXD/siyasat-linux-updsaltrepo
```

- Start installation process as root:
```
$ su - 
# cd /home/siyasat/siyasat-linux
# ./install.sh
```

- This will take a while, so grab a cup of 'kapeng barako' â˜•.
- After a while, you should be presented with the summary of the salt-stack build.

- if after the build, you have some errors (due to any reasons), just re-run the install script until you get '**Failed: 0**' results. You can also try to run:

```
# salt-call -l debug state.apply distro
```
